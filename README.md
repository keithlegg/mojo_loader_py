fork of the mojo loader written in pythonm which is itself a fork of:

https://github.com/mogorman/mojo.py


The original code was meant for Python2 and it says MojoV2 but it seems to work on a V3 

This is a very quick and dirty port to Python3. 

It seems to "work" but not a complete and tested job. 

Yay.
